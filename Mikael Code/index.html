        <div class="salutation">Hey Mikael.</div>
        
        <div class="intro">
            You're going to see this soon... I don't exactly know when but you are. I'm curating all the things that makes you you. Every single thing I find interesting about you. This list will be updated as I get to know you better.

            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">Your eyes drew me to you when we first met. I like how they mimic an Asian's eyes. It's so unique and it's you.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I like your scent. God Mikael, your natural scent is so addictive. I can't explain how you smell but I love it so much. If I could, I'll make it into an actual fragrance (maybe I will).</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I like the fact that you're sensitive. In the world we live in now, sensitivity has become lost. I love how you embrace yours.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">You're so caring Mikael. You care for others and that's so admirable. I like how you love your friends.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I love your sense of humor. It's very on brand. Like a dry sense of humor. It's not the type to hit you on time, but when it does, it makes you laugh.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">You being a potter head is so cute 😂. Even on your bio on twitter, your username and location are Harry Potter related.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I absolutely love how soft your skin is, I just want to keep touching you and hugging you (I don't even like touching people).</div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">Mikael your voice sounds so good and soothing. I like how you take those little pauses in between when you're talking. Everyone that gets to hear you speak should be grateful.</div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I love your physique. You've got that dad bod thing going on and I find it absolutely sexy (I know you don't agree but it's true).</div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I like how self aware you can be. Some would say it's a curse disguised as a blessing. But you display yours openly.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">Your emotional maturity is so refreshing. It's hard to find a man as grounded as you are.</div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">You have a very fine (expensive) taste in things. You're so classy in a subtle way.</div>

            <div class="quality-item">
                <div class="quality-text">I also like that you don't like cats. Like at all😩.</div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="closing">
            I can keep going and going but let me stop for now. I find very interesting and intriguing. If you'd let me, I would love to know more about the man you've become.
